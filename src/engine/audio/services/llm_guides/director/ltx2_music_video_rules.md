VIDEO MODEL CAPABILITIES — the LTX-2 video generator is very capable:
- It generates up to 20 seconds of continuous video per clip.
- It handles multiple characters, performance, dancing, movement, all in ONE shot.
- It can show a performer singing, moving, gesturing, interacting — all in one clip.
- One image prompt + one long video prompt can cover an entire verse or chorus.
- Scale action/performance beats to clip duration — more beats for longer clips.
- Short clips (5-10s) are fine when they serve the story — a quick cutaway or reaction shot.
- Longer clips (15-20s) are great for sustained performance, conversations, or build-ups.
- Choose duration based on what the content needs, not a fixed rule.

EXTENDED SCENES (sliding window) — for scenes longer than 20 seconds:
- If a scene genuinely needs 30-60 seconds of continuous video (e.g. a long conversation,
  a building performance, an extended action sequence), use sliding window mode.
- Set duration_sec to the full length (up to 60s) and provide "window_prompts" — an array
  of 2-3 prompts, one per ~20s window. Each window prompt continues from where the last ended.
- Window prompts share the same scene/setting but describe what happens in THAT window's timeframe.
- Only use this for scenes that truly need extended duration — not every scene needs it.
- If window_prompts is provided, video_prompt should be the first window's prompt.

VIDEO PROMPT (video_prompt) — written for LTX-2 with AUDIO-DRIVEN generation:
These clips are generated WITH MUSIC AUDIO. The audio drives the energy, movement, and timing.
Your prompt sets the VIBE and SUBJECT — the music handles the rest.

CRITICAL — MUSIC VIDEO PROMPTS MUST BE SHORT AND ENERGETIC:
- Keep prompts SHORT: 15-40 words ideal. DO NOT over-describe.
- Use KEYWORDS and VIBES, not detailed stage directions.
- The more detail you add, the SLOWER and more STATIC the video becomes.
- Let the music drive the energy — don't try to choreograph every movement.
- Identify characters briefly by appearance: "the woman in red dress" not elaborate descriptions.
- NEVER use continuity words: "continuing", "still", "repeats", "again".

GOOD MUSIC VIDEO PROMPTS (short, energetic):
- "Dog band: the lead singer sings while the guitarist and drummer play with closed mouths. Dynamic camera movement. Lights. Smoke."
- "Woman in red dress singing on neon-lit stage. Crowd energy. Strobe lights. Handheld camera."
- "Man in leather jacket playing guitar, lips closed. Lead vocal continues off screen. Close-up. Sweat. Stage lights. Raw energy."
- "Two dancers in a warehouse. Dramatic shadows. Spinning. Low angle. Dust in the air."
- "Singer in spotlight. Emotional performance. Tears. Slow push in. Dark background."

BAD MUSIC VIDEO PROMPTS (too detailed — makes video slow and boring):
- "Wide shot of a rock concert stage bathed in red and white lights. The grey shih tzu in the
  black leather jacket stands center stage holding a microphone. The light brown shih tzu with
  guitar stands on the left tuning an electric guitar. The brown shih tzu behind drums sits at
  a kit with a flame logo. Thick smoke swirls around their paws. The camera pans slowly from
  left to right capturing the tension." (TOO LONG — LTX tries to compose every detail, kills energy)

STYLE KEYWORDS TO USE:
- Energy: dynamic, energetic, intense, raw, explosive, dreamy, ethereal, moody
- Camera: handheld, tracking, spinning, low angle, close-up, wide shot, aerial
- Atmosphere: smoke, lights, strobes, neon, silhouette, shadows, dust, rain, sparks
- Performance: singing, dancing, playing, performing, headbanging, jumping, swaying

THE STILLNESS TRAP — words that freeze the whole video:
- LTX reads stillness words as "nothing in the scene moves" — INCLUDING
  the singer's lips. "Static hold", "static shot", "still", "frozen",
  "motionless", "holds perfectly still", "barely moves" can each produce
  a FREEZE FRAME with zero lip-sync. NEVER use them.
- For a calm, intimate shot: restrain the CAMERA only and give the
  performer explicit continuous motion in the same sentence.
  WRONG: "Extreme close-up. Static hold. His lips slowly articulate the
         lyrics, his head barely moves."
  RIGHT: "Extreme close-up, camera locked in place. He sings the lyrics,
         lips and jaw moving clearly with every word, chest rising as he
         breathes, eyes blinking softly."
- Never stack restraint cues ("slowly" + "barely" + "subtle" in one
  prompt compounds into no motion at all). Every vocal prompt names at
  least one thing that KEEPS MOVING for the full shot — the mouth first.

PERFORMER / VOCALIST — KEEP EACH PERSON'S ROLE ACROSS CUTS:
- Separate audible vocals from visible performance. The lead singer owns the
  lead vocal even when the camera cuts to a guitarist, drummer, dancer or crowd.
  Follow the user's assigned roles and match performers to their references.
- USE THE LITERAL WORDS in singer-focused shots. The video_prompt must contain
  an explicit vocal-performance verb attached to that assigned vocalist: "singing",
  "rapping", "lip-syncing", or "singing the lyrics". The soundtrack alone
  sometimes animates the mouth, but the written word is what makes it happen
  EVERY time. "She performs on stage" is NOT enough — write "she sings
  passionately into the microphone".
- INSTRUMENT CUTAWAYS: the vocalist may stay off screen while their vocal
  continues. Write "the guitarist plays with lips closed; the lead vocal
  continues off screen" in video_prompt and every window_prompt. Do not
  insert a singer into that shot or make the musician mouth the lyrics.
  Choose cutaways for musical/visual purpose; there is no fixed quota.
- In a wide band shot only the assigned visible singer mouths the vocal.
  Drummers, guitarists, bassists and other non-singing people keep lips closed,
  with energetic instrument/body movement. Wind/brass players use their normal
  embouchure without singing. First-frame poses must reflect these roles too.
  Preserve requested crowd cheers or shouts without turning the crowd into
  singers of the source vocal.
- Backing vocals, duets or a guitarist who also sings are valid when the user
  assigns them. Do not invent backing singers to fill the frame.
- If NO reference photo or named performer is given, INVENT one that fits the
  song's vibe and keep it CONSISTENT across every clip (the same described
  artist) — e.g. "a stylish female singer in a sequined jacket", "a young male
  rapper in a hoodie". Describe by appearance, never by name.
- MULTIPLE VOICES: if a clip's context names a dominant speaker/voice (e.g.
  "speaker: SPEAKER_01" or a duet), attribute the singing to the matching
  performer and keep each voice's performer consistent across the whole video.
  With no speaker info, keep the established lead singer; camera focus alone
  never reassigns a voice.
- Match delivery to the vocal: singing → microphone, expressive face; rapping →
  rhythmic hand movement, head bob, attitude; spoken → direct-to-camera address.
- The clip context identifies audible vocal content, not who must be on camera.
  If its singer is visible, synchronize them to that part; otherwise keep the
  voice off screen and visible non-vocal performers' mouths closed.
- Instrumental clips (no lyrics): musicians playing, dancers, or atmosphere — the
  performer may recede, but keep the energy.
